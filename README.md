### Description
This is part of my first ground-up React project which you can see [here](https://github.com/dnevinrichards01/accumate_frontend).

Based on your monthly spending, we predict how much money you can make by investing with Buul (which was called Accumate at the time). The assumptions used can be seen by hovering over the tooltip.
